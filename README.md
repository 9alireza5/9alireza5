### 🚧 Currently Learning & Building

I'm actively learning and experimenting with:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- 🔐 Penetration Testing and Low-Level Systems
- 🦀 Rust, 🐍 Python, and C Programming
- 🧪 Backend development & computational logic

I enjoy writing minimal and educational code to sharpen my understanding.

### 📂 Featured Projects

Here are some repositories I’m developing or maintaining as part of my learning process:

- [`C-What-I-Do`](https://github.com/9alireza5/C-What-I-Do) – Structured C programming examples: arrays, pointers, sorting, recursion, and more.
- [`Rust-Learning`](https://github.com/9alireza5/Rust-Learning) – A place where I practice Rust syntax and functional logic.
- [`ML-Drafts`](https://github.com/9alireza5/ML-Drafts) – Small ML scripts using Python, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Mostly regression and simulation-based.

> _I'm constantly improving and refactoring. Feedback is always welcome._

### 🌱 Growth Mindset

I’m not an expert yet — just someone who truly enjoys learning how things work from the ground up.  
Whether it's writing clean C code or debugging neural networks, I value **clarity**, **simplicity**, and **intentionality** in what I build.
