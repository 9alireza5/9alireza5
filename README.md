<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Alireza 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  🛠️ Currently learning low-level programming and exploring the world of software engineering.
</p>

---

### 🚀 What I'm focusing on:

- 🦀 **Rust** — my main focus; building a strong foundation in systems programming.
- 🖥️ **C** — diving deeper into how computers work under the hood.
- 🛠️ **Assembly** — starting to understand the very core of how code runs on hardware.
- 🐍 **Python** — using it occasionally for quick tasks, scripting, and experimenting with AI.

---

### 📚 Current Status:

I'm a Master's student in **Structural Engineering** at the University of Tehran, but I’m also very passionate about programming.  
Right now I’m spending a lot of time learning **Rust**, **C**, and **Assembly**, with a long-term goal of understanding systems, kernels, and cybersecurity.

### 🌱 What I believe in:

- Learning step by step — no rush, no shortcuts.
- Writing clean, simple code.
- Being curious about how things *really* work.
